	*. release version 2.0

	*. change the gap_comp() function
	   (this is one of the two key changes that improve the measurement 
	   accuracy)

	*. add the "-k" option to allow multiple sample for each source gap
	   (this is the other key change that can improves the measurement 
	   accuracy)

	*. fast_probing() is changed to accommodate the above two factors 

	*. remove the "-m" option
	   (it causes too much confusion)

 	*. remove sanity checking for source gap values
	   (it doesn't has much impact on measurement accuracy)

	*. output format is changed
	   (remove the output of path capacity and path load---the value of 
	   this tool really shouldn't be judged based on the path-capacity 
	   measurement; we also explicitly suggest to use PTR values)

	*. change source file name from igi_* to ptr-*
	   (these names, together with the original README, mislead people 
	   to think that IGI is better; actually PTR works better than IGI, 
	   because it is less subject to traffic burstiness)
